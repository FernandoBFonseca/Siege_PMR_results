# Siege_PMR_results â™¿

This was a project I developed between 2021-2023 during my first two years at Centrale Lille. It is a project designed to filter shocks and vibrations in a wheelchair, and to keep the chair stable in a steady position regardless of the slope of the terrain. The idea came from a client (M. Henry-Albert THOOR) whose wife is tetraplegic (no movement from the neck down), so that any movement or inclination of the chair makes her very uncomfortable, thus the need emerged to modify an existing motorised chair so that we could control the position of the seat independently from the rest of the chair, in order to stabilise the seat.

I believe that for legal reasons I can not share the codes, circuits and control systems developed by me and my comrades during this 1.5 years of project =( , but anyway, now that the project is over, I think it would be interesting to make a small folder with photos and videos of the final results, so here it is, enjoy!!
